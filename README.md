# Studie4SU

Studie4SU is a web platform for students in Suriname to explore higher-education options, compare study programs, view open house events, and take a study-choice quiz that recommends programs based on their interests and profile.

The project combines a static multi-page frontend with an Express API and a Prisma/MySQL database. It also includes an admin area for managing schools, programs, quiz content, open houses, users, platform settings, and quiz statistics.

## Features

- Browse schools and view school detail pages with linked study programs.
- Browse study programs and open detailed program pages.
- Take a study-choice quiz and receive stored recommendations.
- Compare programs on a dedicated comparison page.
- Save favorite schools, programs, and open houses.
- Register and log in with JWT-based authentication.
- Request password reset emails and complete password resets.
- Browse upcoming open houses and register for events when logged in.
- View an About page whose content can be managed from admin settings.
- Access an admin dashboard to manage:
  - schools
  - programs
  - quiz questions and answers
  - open houses
  - users
  - platform settings
  - quiz result statistics


## IMPORTANT NOTE:
Unfortunately, our online database has since been shut down, which means some features are no longer functional and certain pages can no longer be accessed. The screenshots below only display the pages and features that are still available. As a result, some parts of the application cannot be demonstrated anymore.

We appreciate your understanding.

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express
- Prisma ORM
- MySQL
- JWT authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Nodemailer for password reset email delivery

**Frontend**
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

**Development tools**
- Nodemon

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- A MySQL database

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Veroush/studie4su.git
cd studie4su
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create a `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the variables used by the app:

```env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL="mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:3306/DATABASE"
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

SMTP_HOST="your_smtp_host"
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER="your_smtp_user"
SMTP_PASS="your_smtp_password"
SMTP_FROM="studiesu <no-reply@example.com>"
```

### 4. Set up the database

Generate the Prisma client, apply migrations, and optionally seed the database:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed
```

If you are developing locally and want to create/update the schema interactively, you can use `npx prisma migrate dev` instead of `npx prisma migrate deploy`.

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

After starting the server, the frontend pages are served from the `public/` directory.

### Main pages

- `/` - home page
- `/schools.html` - school directory
- `/school-detail.html` - school detail page
- `/program-detail.html` - program detail page
- `/program-compare.html` - program comparison page
- `/quiz.html` - study-choice quiz
- `/open-houses.html` - open house overview
- `/favorites.html` - saved favorites
- `/about.html` - about page
- `/login.html` - login and registration entry point
- `/forgot-password.html` and `/reset-password.html` - password recovery flow
- `/settings.html` - user settings page

### Admin pages

Admin-facing screens are available as static pages such as:

- `/admin-dashboard.html`
- `/admin-schools.html`
- `/admin-programs.html`
- `/admin-quiz.html`
- `/admin-openhouses.html`
- `/admin-users.html`
- `/admin-settings.html`
- `/admin-statistics.html`

The corresponding API routes are protected with JWT authentication, and admin-only routes also require the authenticated user to have the `admin` role.

### API overview

The Express app exposes route groups for:

- `/auth` - registration, login, password reset flow
- `/api/quiz` - quiz recommendation and quiz result submission
- `/schools` - public school data
- `/programs` - public study program data
- `/openhouses` - public open house data and event registration
- `/favorites` - favorite schools, programs, and open houses
- `/admin` - admin CRUD and reporting routes
- `/admin/settings` - admin platform settings
- `/api/about` - public about-page content from admin settings

## UI Description

Studie4SU is a multi-page website rather than a single-page app. The public side includes a landing page, school and program browsing pages, a quiz flow, open house listings, favorites, and an about page. The admin side provides dedicated management pages for content and reporting. Styling and page behavior are implemented with page-specific CSS and vanilla JavaScript files inside `public/css` and `public/js`.

## Future Improvements

- Add automated tests for API routes and frontend behavior.
- Add a production-ready build and deployment guide.
- Consolidate route/controller organization where overlapping open house logic exists.
- Remove unused dependencies or document future integrations if they are kept.

## Notes

- The current `npm test` script is a placeholder and does not run a real test suite.
- The app depends on a configured database and environment variables before most pages and API routes will work correctly.
